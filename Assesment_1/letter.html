    <p>Dear Eileen,<br/><br/>
    Thank you for your recent appication to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as 
    part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

    <h2><strong>Starting dates</strong></h2>
    <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the begining of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>First semester: <time datetime="2016-09-09"> 9 September 2016</time></li>
        <li>Second semester: <time datetime="2017-01-15">15 January 2017</time></li>
        <li>Third semester: <time datetime="2017-05-02">2 May 2017</time></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.<br/>
        You can also find more information about <a href="http://example.com">important university dates</a> on our website.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>Subjects of study</strong></h2>
    <p>
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a petty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent,dedicated researcher, and just 
        the kind of person we'd like to have on out team. Sying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued 
        by are as follows, in the order of priority:

    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30&deg;C(86&deg;F), when the
            audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)
        </li>
        <li><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores</li>
    </ol>
    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the 
    research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd nedd to know? Thanks.
    </p>
    <h2><strong> Exotic dance moves</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,
        my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:

    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
        <dd>
            A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around
            in a cirsle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be <q>fruitful</q>
        </dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly
            tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance insipired
            mordern styles such as Twerking.
        </dd>
        <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have
            discovered a new dance style characterised by <q>robotic</q> , stilted movements, being practised by inhibitants
            of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this
            because they were really cold.
        </dd>
